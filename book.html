                                 <p>The book consists of four chapters representing four fundamental elements of the world: earth, water, fire, air.</p>
                                 <p>Fire - the beginning of a full-scale invasion, the first days and months of the occupation.Battles for the region: the stories are full of terror and pain.</p>
                                 <p>Earth - the period of occupation and liberation.</p>
                                 <p>Stories about the unbreakable Ukrainian spirit and various forms of resistance to the invaders; stories about people, whose spirit is as strong as solid earth.</p>
                                 <p>Water - the distruction of the Kakhovka HPP and its consequences.Stories about help and rescue, flood relief and adaptation.</p>
                                 <p>Air - stories of the present and the recent past.Thoughts, hopes, expectations - all that keeps people living now. Uncertainty of the future.</p>

                                 <p>them. Stories that need to be heard. 12 Ukrainian artists were inspired by the experiences recorded in the stories and, combining them with their own memories, created the artistic design of the book - illustrations and calligraphy.</p>
                                 <p>Lamentation not only as a memory of dead, tortured, wounded and missing Ukrainians; of the destruction of houses, villages and cities, families; broken human destinies; of pain for all that was destroyed by the Russian aggressor, but also as something that gives strength to endure this sadness.</p>
                                 <p>Lamentation as a form of addressing the world and recording the life of Kherson and the Kherson region today: life in all its manifestations - those that inspire hope and those that bring sadness.</p>

Every post you make can get them into real trouble. Don't write anything to them unless they write themselves. My wife made a post that began with the words "100 days of war" on the day I was being interrogated in Skadovsk. My mother also posted the same content. And all this, accordingly, I have in my phone. I cleaned the feed in advance, deleted friends, but did not delete relatives. I should have... On the road there was no connection.

                                 <p>So, I decided to go and pick up our car. The route was through Zaporizhzhia. There is a large car market, it was turned into a checkpoint. Like a border crossing, only in Ukraine - between the free and the occupied territory. We formed a column, we are going. Ukrainian checkpoints every couple of kilometers. Maybe there were 7 or 10 of them. On the second or third a jam formed, everything stopped.</p>
                                 <p>And then it starts exploding on the left, about four explosions. The bus is shaking so hard that it is about to tip over. We understand that if the missile was fired from the left side, then it will hit on the right side. And the column is standing.</p>

                                 <p>And rockets started hitting again. I look at all this, I pray to the Lord and think, do I really need that car? Why did I go? I should have stayed at home with my family. I think about our son, how he will grow up without me. We drove on, the driver is in a state of affect, squeezing everything he can out of the bus. We speed through all this gray area. Stopped at McDonald's, bought burgers and potatoes, cold Cola, to eat out the stress. Only then did I call home. My parents are crying, Ilona is crying. Someone told them that they saw me killed by a shell, but there was no connection. Oleksiy, Kakhovka</p>

                                 <p>Ilona, Kakhovka: They chatted that, for example, for someone, this is a positive situation that we have at the moment.

                                 <p>friends that they were leaving. Of course, this is a complicated issue, and everyone acted according to the situation. There were also emotional moments when I thought of giving everything up. It was scary. But then comes the understanding that you have just one life after all. 50 years are already behind you, and you will not live to be 150. And the business that you have been building for more than twenty years is not about making money. It's about responsibility. The people who work for you also need a salary. They have no food in stock. They need to get paid on time. And you pay. You work on warehouse leftovers, three days a week, but keep 70% of the team. And you understand that you have nothing to be ashamed of for your life and your actions. <br>Valery Kherson</p>

                                 <p>My car is totally broken! There is no rear window! I just left the shelling. And it was the missing license plate that surprised you?"</p>

                                 <p>Leonid, Berislav: "Surprisingly, our gypsies helped"</p>
                                 <p>I was very disappointed with the actions of our administration. They did not move a finger to help. Pharmacies were full of drugs, but they all closed on February 24. People appealed to the mayor to open them, the elderly people were without medicines. He said: It's private property, I can't do anything. Same with the food. Moreover, the head of our regional state administration only posted on Facebook on the 72nd day of the war: "I'm fine. Don't worry." Do you think this is normal? She was not seen or heard from for two and a half months. Do we also have to worry about her?</p>
                                 <p>Surprisingly, our gypsies helped. They were the first to start supplying food, medicine, and cigarettes. It was the Roma community that took care of this, not the administration, not the city government. Of course, for money. But since shops and pharmacies are closed, everyone was in a panic, you couldn't buy anything at all, psychologically, it was major relief for people when they started importing medicines and grocery, even if they cost a lot of money.</p>

                                 <p>Yana, Kherson: "This is the woman who comes for the paintings"</p>
                                 <p>Just before the invasion, we were preparing an exhibition for the 50th anniversary of the Union of Artists. A serious event, our chairman said, "Bring your best work." Here comes February 24, of course, no one is thinking about the exhibition anymore, it is impossible to take the paintings back. I call the regional administration, they warn us not to even think of doing anything by ourselves. Then the occupation started.</p>
                                 <p>I'm patient until mid-March, then I go to the Russian commandant's office and say: return the paintings. I went there once, twice, three, four times... They had three commandants changed during this time. Everyone says: "Why do you need these paintings? People are tortured, killed, and you bother us with your artists." For me, it was a way to overcome fear. I was very scared to go there, to endure half a day of interrogations. They already knew me there, they said: "This is the woman who comes for the paintings." While you wait, you will be asked about politics. "Are you an artist? Do you draw on military themes?” - “No. I am not interested in politics. I paint watermelons, pumpkins, plums, children, women, daisies”. Someone asks me: "Do you know an artist called Zozulia?" His works were also at the exhibition. I, naively, was very surprised, but I told everything, praised Zozulia as much as I could. The time has come to take away the paintings, someone is missing two paintings, someone is missing one. There is not a single painting of Zozulia.</p>
                                 <p>Everything was stolen. There were a total of 80 paintings at the exhibition, 49 were returned. I ask: "Where are the rest of the works?" They answer, this is everything they had. When people with automatic weapons talk to you, you don't really argue.</p>

                                 <p>During the occupation, I was impressed by the large number of fish on the market during the spawning period - April and early May. Kherson was flooded with fish. Beryslav was filled with fish. Even on the websites, they wrote: “What is being done? The river is full of nets, no control, nobody does anything!”</p>
                                 <p>I understand that in that state it was impossible to control or remove the nets. Especially if it is done by people with weapons, for example, or under their influence or under their “roof”. But there were complaints, I read these posts with appeals: "Do at least something, because everything is fenced off with nets!" It is one thing if people caught fish for food. But this is industrial fishing. They caught everything they could catch.</p>

In the summer, they were no longer afraid to fly into my room. Now, when I meet titmouse in other cities, I remember my birds, and every time I feel sad that I left them. But I left not only my birds, and that makes me even sadder.</p>

                                 <p>"I still haven't come to terms with my new life"</p>
                                 <p>At the age of thirty, I realized that I wanted to live in Kherson, and for my family to live here. That's why we invested everything in real estate in Kherson, in repairs, etc. And then - kaboom, and the war started. And now I am in Georgia. We are thinking of moving to Moldova to be closer to Ukraine.</p>
                                 <p>I live as if in a fog. I have not come to terms with my new life, I can't see myself anywhere but in Kherson. Furthermore, I do not believe in any victories. I think it will last long. But somewhere deep in my soul, I hope that we will return. As long as we have a place to return to. I'm not planning anything. I do not put down roots anywhere. I just live. It is very difficult to be alone with the little one, and on the other hand, she distracts me from an even greater depression, which would definitely get to me, if I would start thinking about the future, about Kherson and the people there. So I get distracted by everyday life, tantrums and some other strange life.</p>
                                 <p>Once I was in a cast for six months, then it was also difficult, and I thought that nothing good would happen in my life, but then I somehow managed to get out. I think we will break through now. It can't last forever. Despite everything, we are alive - both the city and us.</p>

                                 <p>I see fresh fish being sold on the Dniprovskyi market. Guys, where are they from? From there. From the Dnipro. Great, I think, I'll try it too. In the morning, I went to the old voenkom beach with a spinning. I cast a fishing rod. I'm standing and waiting, And there it goes. A line from machine gun bullets on the water tuk-tuk-tuk. 20 meters from me.</p>
                                 <p>I'm running away. Well, fuck this kind of fishing. And the neighbor walks in. Asks me: "Can I treat you with a rudd?" OK, come on. I thought he would give me a couple of fishes, but he gave me half a bucket. I ask: "Aren't you afraid to go fishing?" “I am, but what can you do, when there is so much fish”.  Thanks for the fish, of course, but it would be better if he didn't go there. They say that recently one fisherman was shot by a sniper.</p>

                                 <p>We left the occupation at the end of April, we hired driver called Serhiy who was recommended. He took us and another family from Kherson. We left with him in the morning, passed almost all the roadblocks, until we stopped at one of them with all the other cars. The invaders say, turn around: "We won't let anyone until the end of May hollydays."</p>
                                 <p>It must be said here that the drivers who were involved in the evacuation are very brave and adventurous guys. Serhii says: "To hell with them, let's go around through the dirt road." Turned off the headlights and drove through the fields and gardens. At night, we stopped in some dark village, asked to sleep in a house, tried to sleep a little, and at 5 in the morning we set off. At the first checkpoint, a sleepy soldier came out and asked: why so early. Serhii answered that…</p>

                                 <p>we were sent this way from the previous checkpoint. Then we drove up to the second checkpoint - there was no one there. The driver tells me: "Quietly, without knocking the door, get out and lift the barrier." I unscrew the wire on the barrier and think, lets hope nobody uncharges an AK at me at this point. The next checkpoint was already Ukrainian and the military looked at us very surprised. A day before we came (and three more days after we passed), the invaders did not let a single car pass. That's how we got out of the occupation.</p>

Later, they were rescued by a local, he took them on a boat to the roof of a high-rise building. A lot is said about flooded houses, furniture, appliances. But Russians drowned much more important things - our memories</p>

Is there no other place to rest? There is a war! Go to where hell is! Not only do they risk their lives, but they also endanger the doctors, who go to take them from the shelling.</p>

                                 <p>Oleg, Kherson: "They asked to bring 5 million hryvnias for our pensioners"</p>
                                 <p>A normal evacuation from Kherson looked like this. We formed a column of 2-3 Red Cross buses. Sometimes other volunteers also joined us. They took the children, wives of soldiers of ATO, often with forged documents, because then there were already lists and people could be taken. Of course, we drove through Oleshki, at first there were 25 checkpoints, then a few more were added. Block posts with soldiers are not so bad, but LPR and DPR soldiers are terrible, they are dirt, shit, not people. Dirty, stand there, begging: give batteries, give flashlights, give tomatoes. Why doesn’t the second army of the world provide for you? It was disgusting to watch. The Russians themselves considered them vagrants.</p>
                                 <p>The most nightmarish block-post was the last one, counting from Kherson. FSB snipers were standing there. Unload everything, then load it again. Insulin was not allowed to be brought in, although we did so anyway. Once we even transported money in a box for bananas. People came to me in Zaporizhzhia and said that we need to bring 5 million hryvnias for our pensioners to the occupied territory. Payments do not go through, people are without pensions. None of my colleagues knew, I only confessed to them later, when Ihanded over the money at Ukrposhta. Our people shuddered. That box of bananas was lying in the most prominent place in the bus, no one paid attention to it.</p>

They watered tomatoes and cucumbers in the morning, everything was fine, if anything goes wrong, they say, we will leave by car. The water arrived at six o'clock in the evening. It poured so quickly that they didn't even have time to get the car out of the garage. They only had time to climb to the second floor. They stayed there for a week and a half until they were taken away.</p>

And I learned a story from the neighbors that makes my hair stand on end! In the neighboring house, an old woman with limited mobility died of hunger! In the city, where there are food kits, humanitarian headquarters work, an elderly lady died a terrible death!</p>
                                 <p>You feel bad not just for people, even for dogs. While I was there, I fed them every day, took canned food to them in the yard. I could not just let it go. Their owners abandoned them, they left, and the dogs were left behind. They run in packs. And how it happened that a person died of hunger, I can't even imagine. Couldn't anyone visit her at least once every few days?!</p>

So now I myself indicate to which office the packages should be sent. And it is not the closest. We have our own geography here. Not everything is more convenient that is closer.</p>

The soldiers - that's what I saw, or those who can be seen leaving the hospital. And yesterday in the store, an elderly stranger treated me with a cream-horn just for the fact that I let him enter the door before me. This was my first cream-horn in a year and a half. There is no such thing in Europe.</p>

They asked: "Tell me what you know about the facts of rape in your military unit." And they tell how their commanders raped them. And the military police is in complete shock: "No. We are asking about the facts of violence against civilians in your military unit. What, were you raped too?!" And the military say: "Yes."

A soldier approaches: "Are you a Banderovka?" - "No. I lived in Aleksandrovka." People from the villages who had a more or less good car - they all drove their cars to the city, here you can hide them in garages. In the city they are still trying not to openly violate the law, but in the villages they will simply take everything. I have an acquaintance, his KAMAZ was taken away. They came and said: "Nam nada." (We need it) If you try to oppose them, there is only one answer: "Wonna go to the basement?" This is their favorite phrase: "You'll go to the basement."</p>

Vodka is 150 UAH a bottle, it just flies away. I don't understand how this is possible. The Dnipro market sells alcohol until half past ten. There is a family in which the husband goes to the store every day, buys a bottle of champagne and drinks it. He didn't drink at all before. He is under so much pressure, psychologically can't stand it. Some people use Medazepam to fall asleep, others use alcohol.</p>

There is nothing left in the house, after a few Russian visits everything was taken away by trucks. I looked into the window - they took even the electric kettle”.</p>

Several people live in the house now, prostitutes are brought in every day.

In Ossetia, on the border with Georgia, we were taken off the bus and put in the prison cell. The FSB agents are, of course, enemies, but they are educated and understand the context. And in Ossetia, these representatives of the border guard are as stupid as a brick of soap. They locked me up, took away my phone, run around, shout: "Who are you?" "Who are you?" But I got through. Now I’m in Germany. I want to go to a chiropractor, because, after the Russian interrogation procedures, my back won't stop hurting.</p>

                                 <p>A week after the battles for the city ended, and the orcs captured Kherson, they came to our emergency department. First they went to the main office. I don't know what they talked about there and what was done with them, but many of our people did not come back to work. A Russian administration was created in the building itself.</p>
                                 <p>We were offered to go over to their side, we refused. At first, they did not press, they said, continue working, extinguish fires, do not stand in our way. Then they started the pressure.</p>
                                 <p>Signs on buildings: “Emergency services: prevent, save, help”, “Head Department”</p>

                                 <p>FSB officers took 5 people to interrogation, took away their phones, if they found pro-Ukrainian content or those who reported Ukrainian army about their positions - they put a bag on their head. Once, we were forced into the basement, and several men with assault rifles immediately followed us. It turned out that a Russian deputy minister came to Kherson that day. And they had information that the Armed Forces of Ukraine would strike. So they decided to show the authorities how they care about the local population.</p>
                                 <p>It's funny now, but for me, it was the scariest moment of the entire period of the occupation. Soon after that, I stopped going to work. At that time, they were no longer trying to persuade us to go "to the dark side", but simply asked: yes or yes? 90% of the staff refused. So little by little we began to move into the territory controlled by Ukraine; I personally left at the end of august</p>
