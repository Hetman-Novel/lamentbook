                              <p>The "Lament of Kherson region" project is the creation of a unique Book of stories of the inhabitants of the Kherson region, which was produced using the technologies of the 10th century. Ukrainian, in particular, Kherson artists during a 10-day residency in Tallinn, Estonia, under the mentorship of Mr. Anatoly Lyutyuk.</p>
                              <p>From the first days of the war until today, Kherson Oblast has been partially occupied, already free Kherson and the right bank are under attack from the enemy.</p>
                              <p>Sudden occupation, daily shelling, blowing up of the Kakhovskaya HPP dam, basements and torture, killing of civilians, including children and animals, are only a part of what is actually happening in Kherson region. Destroyed libraries, burned books, exported cultural values, killed cultural figures, the imposition of the Russian language and culture on the occupied territories, and alongside these horrors - ordinary life: trying to survive, work, teach children in Ukrainian schools, help the Armed Forces and sometimes try rest, so as not to go crazy.</p>
                              <p>The stories of people who experienced and continue to experience these events were collected by us and included in the great Book "Lament of the Kherson Region".</p>
                              <p>The Lament of the Kherson region is a unique book that consists of 52 stories of the residents of the Kherson region, illustrated by artists during a 10-day residency in Tallinn, Estonia, under the mentorship of the legendary man Anatoly Lyutyuk.</p>

                              <p>Before starting the residency, the project team conducted long and painstaking work. <br>First, it is a collection of stories. Kherson sociologists under the leadership of the project producer, sociologist Mykola Homanyuk collected about 70 documentary stories told to them by ordinary people, residents of the Kherson region. The names of the characters in the stories have been changed for security reasons.</p>
                              <p>Simultaneously with the collection of stories, the curator of the project from Ukraine, Volodymyr Reinhart, held an open call, where any artist could submit his portfolio and be selected for the residency. During the selection, priority was given, of course, to artists from the Kherson region.</p>
                              <p>Meanwhile, preparations were being made in Estonia for the arrival of the guests: drawing paper and ink were being prepared and the general concept of working with artists was being developed.</p>
                              <p>The main event of the project is a 10-day residency, during which the illustrations for the collected stories were created. <br>10 artists selected during the open call came to Tallinn for 10 days to work together on the book. Along with them, Volodymyr Reinhart, project curator from Ukraine, and Mykola Homanyuk, project producer, took part in creating illustrations for the book.</p>

                              <p>In 10 days, the artists made illustrations and calligraphy for 52 stories, creating 11 chapters of their own in the book.

                              <p>For example, Maria Apryatova, who is engaged in encyclopedic watercolors on the subject of animals and plants, selected stories related to them in one way or another, and Marianna Tarish, who spent the first weeks of the occupation in Kherson, in the Ostriv microdistrict, made a scope the main theme of her illustrations. target as a symbol of how she felt at that time.</p>
